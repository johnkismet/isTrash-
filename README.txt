This is a silly project, it's just practice for if else statements essentially. It takes in the amount of songs in an album and how many times you had to skip songs while listening to the album and "calculates" whether or not the album is bad. 

I have the button good, I'd say. It has a small animation and is placed pretty well on the page (though it could be smaller when we implement the next thing). What I'm trying to do next is add a small text box that explains what's going on.

I don't know if this is the best way to do it, but I created the box & text in Adobe XD and exported that design as a png and added the img in HTML. I know I could have made it all in code, but I'm not sure how or if that's necessary.
